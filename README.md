#Entaq
A project for helping people with special needs achieve better communication through online voice-based platforms like Zoom and Meet. 
The project allows the user to make handsigns through the camera, then the program translates his handsigns using Deep Learning and says the predicted text to all other attendees in the meeting. The prototype currently is Zoom-based, where the user is expected to make his handsigns in Zoom camera and all other attendees will understand his handsigns through an AI voice.
The project is under development, more details will be added soon. Stay Tuned!
